## Soul Coins

Soul Coins are a central element in the Tournament at the End of Time, acting as a non-physical representation of a champion's success, popularity, and prowess.

### Nature of Soul Coins
Soul Coins are intangible tokens tied to each champion's essence. Champions are given a small crystal that displays the number of Soul Coins they possess. These crystals also allow champions to gauge others' coin quantities in relative terms (e.g., less than them, way more than them).

### How to Obtain Soul Coins
1. **Performance and Popularity**: Champions earn Soul Coins by engaging in the tournament activities and fighting for the crowd's attention and affection. Impressive performances, demonstrations of skill, and crowd-pleasing actions automatically increase a champion's Soul Coins.
2. **Defeating Other Champions**: Champions can acquire Soul Coins from others by defeating them in combat. As physical death is impossible in the tournament, rendering an opponent unconscious is sufficient for victory. It is a common practice among honorable champions to leave the defeated with at least one Soul Coin, allowing them to remain in the tournament.

### Uses of Soul Coins
- **Toll of Passage**: Champions must accumulate enough Soul Coins to pay the Toll of Passage to advance from the Crucible to the Gauntlet of Valor.
- **Currency**: Soul Coins serve as currency for purchasing gear, magical items, information, or services within the tournament.
- **Influence on Rank and Power**: The number of Soul Coins a champion holds directly impacts their rank and perceived power, influencing their journey through the tournament.

### Significance in Fame and Rank
- **Indicator of Prestige**: A high number of Soul Coins boosts a champion's prestige, influencing respect and admiration from others.
- **Determinant of Challenges and Alliances**: Champions with substantial Soul Coins are often sought after for alliances or viewed as worthy opponents for challenges.
- **Influence on Public Perception**: The quantity of Soul Coins affects how champions are viewed by the audience and immortals, shaping their fame and potential for patronage.

Soul Coins are fundamental to the Tournament at the End of Time, symbolizing achievement, reputation, and the ability to captivate both the crowd and fellow competitors. They play a crucial role in the progression, politics, and dynamics of the tournament.
